# Conway's Game of life 

The [Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a zero player game invented by [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) in 1970.

The game involves a grid that contains cells. In order to play the game an initial state of the 
grid is set. Each cell can either be one of two state(**alive** or **dead**). The initial state of the grid is called the first generation. Subsequent generations are determined by [Rules of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules).

## Rules

1. Any alive cell that has two or three neighbors that are alive lives to the next generation due to cooperation.
2. Any alive cell with less than two neigbours dies due to underpopulation.
3. Any dead cell with three neighbors comes to life due to reproduction.
4. Any alive cell with more than three living neighbours dies due to overpopulation
